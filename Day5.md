# Le backend with React

Until know we have been loading in data from json files. Today, we're going to get the data from web API's. In your own projects, you'll make your own web API. They work almost the same way as the backend in module 2. Instead of sending back rendered html, you only send back json. React will base its rendering on that JSON, similar to how hbs bases its rendering on the data you passed in the render function.

After today you will:

* Understand how React communicates with the backend
* You'll be able to get data with Axios from an API endpoint instead of importing json
* Understand why you need the lifecycle method componentDidMount
* Use componentDidMount in combination with Axios and setState
* know how forms are handled by React
* use a form in combination with axios to make a POST request
* the lab of today: lab-react-ironbeers! (use https://ih-beers-api.herokuapp.com) 

Monday and Tuesday we are going to work on authentication with React. It works very similar as with traditional apps, but there are some differences as well. The most important one is that session data lives on the front- and backend. Also, most SPA apps use token based authentication instead of authentication with cookies.

Wednesday is Project time! Please think about what you wan to make during this weekend. Wednesday we are going to start with coding. You will need to know before then what you'll make and with whom.
