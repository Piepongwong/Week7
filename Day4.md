# Routing!

We know React is used to create Single Page Applications (SPA's). So what about anchor tags and the back and forward buttons of the browser? Users are accustomed to this interface. They expect that links and the back and forward buttons are working. However,these normally cause the user to leave the current page. React is a SPA. React-router replaces this functionality and, as it turns out, adds something to it.
