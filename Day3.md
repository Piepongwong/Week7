# Lifting state up and routing

We are going discuss two separate topics today. The first is lifting state up and the second is routing. By lifting state up a child component can communicate with its parent component. React-router enables us to navigate between different sections of our site without refreshing the browser.

After today you'll:

* Understand what lifting state up means and how the naming is a bit off
* Understand how lifting state up fits in Reacts data flow, in particular compared to state and props
* Be able to finish iteration 4 of yesterday's lab
* Be able to apply yesterday's concepts with today's in the <a href="https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-react-ironnutrition"> Ironnutrition lab exercise</a>
